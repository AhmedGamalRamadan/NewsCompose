# News App in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose

## Description
The News App is a mobile application developed using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It's designed to fetch news articles from a provided API and display them in a user-friendly interface.
The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Features:
- **Jetpack Compose:** The app leverages *Jetpack Compose*, a modern Android UI toolkit, to create a seamless and interactive user experience.
- **Kotlin:** Developed entirely in *Kotlin*, the codebase benefits from the conciseness and expressiveness of the language, promoting efficient and readable code.
- **Retrofit:** Fetches news articles from an API.
- **Implements MVVM architecture for clean and organized code.**

## Work in Progress
This project is still under development and certain features may be incomplete or subject to change. Here's what's currently in progress:

- **Implementing UI for displaying news articles.**
- **Adding functionality to fetch news articles from the API.**
